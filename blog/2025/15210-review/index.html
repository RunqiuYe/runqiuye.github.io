The instructors are Danny Sleator and Umut Acar. Might be an unpopular opinion, especally among the people who took this class the same semester as me, but overall I think I like this class, I got an A for the class, and I would give this class a solid 8 out of 10 for the quality and experience.</p> <p>With 15150 introduction to functional programming as a prerequisite, this class also uses Standard ML as its language. This is probably the thing I like the least of the class. Becuase of the strongly-typed nature of SML, it is quite difficult to print things and debug code for homework. This is even worse when you are using some data structures like trees. But I guess this is the price you need to pay for the “parallel” part of the course. I should probably study something more about functional language, especially OCaml by myself, but I don’t think I have the time for that now.</p> <p>I speak highly of the quality of the course. The course basically introduces all the most basics of the algorithms. The homework problems are also classic and inspiring algorithm problems. Aside from that, the parallel part of the course is quite interesting. This means we not only need to care about the work, which is the traditional sense of time complexity, but also we need to care about span. Sometimes there is an interesting trade off between each other, as the optimal work solution might be purely sequential. I think the course is a great introduction to basic algorithm knowledge, and more in-depth content will probably be covered in the sequel of this course – 15451 algorithm design and analysis, which I will take next semester.</p> <p>Now for the difficulty of the course, I again have to put forward the potentially unpopular opinion that the difficulty of the class has been exaggerated. For the grading scheme, there is a 75% bucket system for the homeworks, therefore I think that is easy to max out as long as efforts have been put in and there haven’t been several accidents. Midterms and finals are 15%, 15% and 20% of the final grade respectively, and they are widely described as “very hard”. In my opinion this is simply not true. The first midterm might caught people off guard, because the actual exam is indeed more problems and harder than the practice exams. But for the second midterm and the final people should already be clear about one fact – the practice exams the course staff provided are NOT representative of the acutal exam AT ALL. In particular, they are visibly too easy for the exam, and the number of problems are simply too few for the given time. Some people describe the exam as “impossible” in discussion groups like Discord. I think this is misleading. For all the exams, I do think the exam problems is a natural extension of the content in class and homework, and it is not a wild extension. If work has been put into the course content and homework problems, the exams are definitely not at the level of “impossible”. The fear for the exam mostly stem from the fact that if you don’t come up with the correct algorithm for the problem, you get minimum amount of points. However, there are just so few algorithms that has been covered in class, and each problem needs at most one of them. Therefore again I would say the exams problems are definitely fair, and it is closely related to the course so I think it is well written.</p> <p>One problem in particular seems to trigger some controversy. One of them is during midterm 2, a problem asks for a constant in a proof covered in class. In my opinion this is a bad problem, because the answer is not the unique constant that will make the statement true. It is of course hard to recall this specific number when it is actually not the unique answer. Even though I attended almost every lecture, but I really don’t have a deep impression on this. I tried to reproduce the proof and ultimately magically get the right answer. Some people refer to this as “lecture trivia” and was quite bothered by this 4 point question in an exam with an average of 60+. Personally I do not think this is a big deal because most people really cannot get this, and the course have a very generous curve for the final grade. This is also the only instance where something so niche show up on the exam.</p> <p>All in all, I again want to state my point that the exam problems are fair, and the difficulty is exaggerated by some people. Despite the exam being a mild time crunch, with all the questions being a natural extension of class materials, I could not quite understand the very low average score, but why complaining for a good curve, albeit I do not need it.</p> <p>Other than this, I have some comment on the teaching of the course. The teaching and course organization are obviously not good. Notably the algorithm needed for one homework problem is not even covered. That is also one of the most important algorithm of the section. There are also quite a few bad comments toward Professor Sleator, but I personally think his teaching are fine compared to some other course which I am about to talk about. In particular, I like the way he present things on either blackboard or tablet. I am never the type of person that spend time comparing different professor and adjust my course selections, and I will be taking 15451 with him as one of the instructor next semester.</p> <p>As for preparation of the course, I would say LeetCode definitely helps, especially NeetCode 150. However for most people that are taking the course, LeetCode is already a necessary thing to do for the career, so I guess there’s no such thing as doing it specifically for the course. However, if you haven’t done any of that before the class, this class is actually a good starting point.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/15451-review/">Course review --- CMU 15451</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/super-egg-drop/">Super Egg Drop</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/10701-review/">Course review --- CMU 10701</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/summary/">Two weeks of summer --- summary and reflection</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/setup/">Setting up this website</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Runqiu Ye.
