Now I have spent more than two weeks in Seattle, and I have started my internship at Amazon for two weeks. I am going to put some thoughts and reflections into this document as a brief summary.</p> <p>First of all, the internship at AWS. For a brief recap, I received an online assessment from Amazon near the end of Fall 25 semester, or 0~2 weeks from the finals week to be precise. I was not able to figure out the second coding question, but I guess CMU reputation bailed me out, so I got the interview right when I was protoring the finals for Calculus in 3D. After a not so easy process of scheduling the interview, as I will be in China during winter break, I clutch up on this 3rd interview I got for the year and landed this dream-like internship. As you may already guess this is my first ever internship, not to say one year ago I cannot even code anything. Therefore, I am naturally very nervous, and it is indeed quite tough.</p> <p>Before my first day I know nothing about my team, other than the fact that my interviewer has AWS Bedrock on her LinkedIn. Stepping into the office, I finally saw this sign that says “AWS Data/ML Only”. I was quite lucky honestly, as I am very interested in machine learning. Now two weeks into the internship, I have been getting more and more familiar with my team, and liking it more and more.</p> <p>Our team mostly helps users host LLMs on AWS, and my project is interacting with this whole lifecycle of model hosting to visualize datas and logs. The problem is I know nothing about AWS or cloud computing whatsoever, but thankfully my mentor pointed to me some AWS services I should start getting familiar with, and I found several good youtube videos introducing what is cloud computing and AWS. During these days, I start to become familiar with the common AWS services, and I become more and more interested in this topic. After thinking about it and asking my friend, I decide that it will be a good idea to get a AWS certification this summer during the internship. After some more youtube videos, I bought this class on udemy for AWS cloud-practitioner exam to start studying, and I should figure out how to schedule an exam and all the other stuff soon. I have watched a few sections of this class during the two weeks, and I think I like it a lot. The hands-on help me understand the concepts a lot. I think I should lock in to study more about it, and definitely aiming to get the certification during my internship. Other than that, I have been getting familiar with the architecture and pipeline I will be working with, but of course new challenges are always comming so I have to be ready.</p> <p>Because of the unexpected toughness of the internship, the self-study plan I made before the summer couln’t really work out — I thought I will be motivated enough or have the time to finish off the Standford cs224n (NLP) lectures and do all the homework and the project. I also plan to self-study more ML on the theory side by reading Bishop’s Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. However I was not motivated enough or honestly not having enough time for those. I felt so tired after work every day and I know I should prioritize on the AWS course (even on that I am slacking a bit). So I guess those needs to wait a bit. I should be able to have plenty of time reading PRML when I take 10708 next year, which I am very looking forward to, but I need to come up with some time to do the NLP course and projects, which is more on the practical side with an actual project. I also need to figure out how and where to rent GPU for these, but again cannot really think about these now.</p> <p>Then comes Memorial Day weekend, and I am writing this on the last day of the holiday. I should have also spent more time exploring Seattle, but my friends keep bailing out of the plan so that is kinda annoying. I bought a basketball though so I can now go play basketball every day instead of it depending on someone’s already playing and I can join in UW. I was thinking about going to gym but Amazon’s frugality gives no gym and UW gym is not affordable. Hopefully basketball is good enough and I really need to get the consistency in. I played quite a lot of Pubg mobile for the holiday which is not good, but I guess people need to take break and it is honestly good to play with all my friends again. Last time we play like this is literally before coming to CMU and before meeting in person. Also, AWS course just feels a bit boring this weekend, so I start to read Folland’s real analysis textbook. I am of course interested in this but also I might need to read this to take grad probability and stochastic calculus if I end up doing that (which again I am interested in). It’s much better than the AWS course for sure, probably because I just think I like analysis, even after the very tough math studies analysis course last semester. In particular I am reading the chapter on signed and complex measures, it’s really fun but I haven’t done any exercise yet. I probably should and I need to figure out how should I approach it. Hopefully I can find some online course on this and see if they have a list of problems for the assignments, which is something I always do. At the same time it is also true that I need to get the AWS course back on track if I want to get the certification before my internship ends (which I definitely want).</p> <p>I think that’s pretty much it and I think I am doing a relatively good job. Internship are most certainly tough, but I will ask more questions and hopefully ramp up successfully. For self-study, I should be just prioritizing AWS course and do some real analysis if that’s too boring, might also need to switch with NLP though (too much to do uhh). Hopefully I can use the time after work better. For touching grass I just remembered that I will go Bellevue next week with my friends Daniel and Sunny, and I should also definitely checkout UW wetlands, hopefully with some friends. More ambitious hiking plans are not very tangible at this point even though it sounds good. I also hope I can consistenly work out every day, at least by playing some basketball.</p> <p>Hope for the best.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/15451-review/">Course review --- CMU 15451</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/super-egg-drop/">Super Egg Drop</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/10701-review/">Course review --- CMU 10701</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/15210-review/">Course review --- CMU 15210</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/setup/">Setting up this website</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Runqiu Ye.
