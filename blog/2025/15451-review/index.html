This post is a review on CMU 15451, algorithm design and analysis, a class I took this semester (Fall 2025) with Professor Danny Sleator and Professor Daniel Anderson.</p> <p>This class is the final required algorithm class for the computer science major, following 15210. Compared to 15210, it discusses some more advanced algorithm topics, including lower bound, hashing, segment tree, amortized analysis using potential method, network flows, linear programming, online and streaming algorithms and computational geometry. Course structure wise, it consists of written homework, programming homework, and 2 midterms and a final. There are much more written homework than programming homework.</p> <p>Personally, I think the content of the course is quite good as a sequel to the basic algorithm class 15210. In particular the first part of the course up to linear programming is quite interesting, but I am not a big enthusiast of the approximation algorithms section (online and streaming algorithm). Computational geometry at the end of the semester is also kind of a rush, so I don’t really enjoy it either. Overall, I would give the materials covered in the class a 7 out of 10.</p> <p>In contrast, everything else than the content has much room for improvements. First of all about teaching. Two 1.5-hour lectures on Tuesday and Thursday at 12:30 PM is quite impossible to pay much attention to. I am always a going-to-lecture person but it is not easy to follow the pace of the lectures and gain a decent proportion of the content. In my opinion 1.5 hous for this class is too long. It is common experience for me to expect the lectures to be over after the end of a section with like 15 minutes left and it turns out there is still another section that needs to be covered. As always too much time is spent on introduction to the topic and easy-to-understand stuff, hoping to grab students’ attention. I think it fails to do that exactly and lead to a time crunch for the important parts. As for the quality of the lectures, I think both professors’ teaching is okay but okay at most, even though many people have quite negative experience with Danny Sleator’s lecture. The course is also more theory heavy, often times omitting the implementation details. In particular, little to none real code is shown during lectures or notes, which one could argue is okay or bad for an algorithm class like this. I personally would want to see more code.</p> <p>The logistics of this class is terrible. In particular, the lack of mathematical maturity of (at least a nonempty subset of) the teaching assisstants, and lack of the effort they put into grading homework and exams properly is shocking. They are not willing to turn their brain on for a correct, alternative answer different (or in some case, not even different) than the answer they receive, but they are more than spontaneous when nit picking a correct and complete answer or requiring a proof for a clear and obvious thing when enough is said about the trivial fact. For example, when I give an alternative proof than the intended solution in midterm 1, the grader, without reading my whole proof, take all the points off. Worse, when pointing this out to Daniel Anderson, I was responded with “did you read the comment” x3, although the comment does not make any sense, and “come to office hour”, only to be responded with “I want to talk about something everyone in the office can listen” when I actually went to the office hour. In the same exam, one question is about is proposing an algorithm. While a TA explicitly said “it does not need to be efficient” during the exam, a very common asnwer is initially rejected because supposedly it is not efficient enough. This is fixed later after many complaints. In another homework, many people I know got points off on a proof where the teaching assisstant claims “proving (something) is necessary otherwise the argument will not hold”, when in fact it is not at all necessary to prove that (something) explicitly for the proof to hold. It is shocking when the teaching assisstants got paid to read these proofs and ended up not doing so. Last but not least, sitting in the first row in exam one is a bad decision, as the TAs and Daniel Anderson are constantly talking, laughing, and making noises, without any respect for the students.</p> <p>Another thing for this class is called “oral homework”, where a group of at most 3 people prepare together to present a problem set of 3 questions to a TA. Going back to my previous point, I have negative experience with this. In my first oral homework, although I clearly said “(some operation) used by segment tree is associative because it just calculates the property of the combined interval, which is associative.” The TA, holding a poker face the entire time, ask me why this operation is associative after I finished, and want me to talk about the proof again, even though this proof is already well known from a homework in a previous class. However, we are lucky enough that for some reason, Professor Danny Sleator will be responsible for the oral homework of my group. In a clear constrast with the TAs, he is a very chill and we have great interactions during the oral homework presentation.</p> <p>Overall, I think I learned a lot from the content in this class, and I think this class for sure prepare one to dive deeper in algorithms after the basic algorithms in 15210. But anything else from teaching to logistics have ample room for improvements, to say the least. Additionally, I must put a question mark on the TA hiring process of some of the classes I have taken in CMU. Let me en this post with a comment in a public platform on midterm 1 posted by an anonymous person online who claims to be a TA of this class:</p> <p>“451 students vs not being stupid, test was easy asl if u get less than 85 drop the course its just an iqq diff atp - from a 451 TA.” “The lion wonders how students made it this far without knowing binary search or basic hashing.”</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/super-egg-drop/">Super Egg Drop</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/10701-review/">Course review --- CMU 10701</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/15210-review/">Course review --- CMU 15210</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/summary/">Two weeks of summer --- summary and reflection</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/setup/">Setting up this website</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Runqiu Ye.
