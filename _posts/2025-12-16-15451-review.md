It is not easy but we made it through the fall 2025 semester. This post is 
a review on CMU 15451, algorithm design and analysis, a class I took this 
semester (Fall 2025) with Professor Danny Sleator and Professor Daniel
Anderson.

This class is the final required algorithm class for the computer science 
major, following 15210. Compared to 15210, it discusses some more advanced 
algorithm topics, including lower bound, hashing, segment tree, amortized 
analysis using potential method, network flows, linear programming, 
online and streaming algorithms and computational geometry. 
Course structure wise, it consists of written homework, programming homework,
and 2 midterms and a final. There are much more written homework than programming 
homework. 

Personally, I think the content of the course is quite good as a sequel 
to the basic algorithm class 15210. In particular the first part of the course
up to linear programming is quite interesting, but I am not a big enthusiast 
of the approximation algorithms section (online and streaming algorithm).
Computational geometry at the end of the semester is also kind of a rush,
so I don't really enjoy it either. Overall, I would give the materials 
covered in the class a 7 out of 10.

In contrast, everything else than the content has much room for improvements.
First of all about teaching.
Two 1.5-hour lectures on Tuesday and Thursday at 12:30 PM is quite impossible 
to pay much attention to. I am always a going-to-lecture person but it is 
not easy to follow the pace of the lectures and gain a decent proportion of 
the content. In my opinion 1.5 hous for this class is too long. 
It is common experience for me to expect the lectures to be over after the end 
of a section with like 15 minutes left and it turns out there is still another 
section that needs to be covered. As always too much time is spent on
introduction to the topic and easy-to-understand stuff, hoping to grab 
students' attention. I think it fails to do that exactly and lead to a time crunch 
for the important parts.
As for the quality of the lectures, I think both professors' teaching is okay 
but okay at most, even though many people have quite negative experience 
with Danny Sleator's lecture. The course is also more theory heavy, often 
times omitting the implementation details. In particular, little to none 
real code is shown during lectures or notes, which one could argue is okay 
or bad for an algorithm class like this. I personally would want to see more 
code.

The logistics of this class is terrible. In particular, the lack of mathematical 
maturity of (at least a nonempty subset of) the 
teaching assisstants, and lack of the effort 
they put into grading homework and exams properly is shocking. They are not 
willing to turn their brain on for a correct, alternative answer different
(or in some case, not even different) 
than the answer they receive, but they are more than spontaneous when nit
picking a correct and complete answer or requiring a proof for a clear and 
obvious thing when enough is said about the trivial fact. For example, when 
I give an alternative proof than the intended solution in midterm 1, 
the grader, without reading my whole proof, take all the points off. Worse, 
when pointing this out to Daniel Anderson, I was responded with "did you read 
the comment" x3, although the comment does not make any sense, and "come to
office hour", only to be responded with "I want to talk about something everyone 
in the office can listen" when I actually went to the office hour. 
In the same exam, one question is about is proposing an algorithm.
While a TA explicitly said "it does not need to be efficient" during the exam, 
a very common asnwer is initially rejected because supposedly it is 
not efficient enough. This is fixed later after many complaints.
In another homework, 
many people I know got points off on a proof where the teaching assisstant 
claims "proving (something) is necessary otherwise the argument will not hold",
when in fact it is not at all necessary to prove that (something) explicitly 
for the proof to hold. It is shocking when the teaching assisstants got paid 
to read these proofs and ended up not doing so.
Last but not least, sitting in the first row in exam one is a bad decision, 
as the TAs and Daniel Anderson are constantly talking, laughing, and making noises,
without any respect for the students. 

Another thing for this class is called "oral homework", where a group of 
at most 3 people prepare together to present a problem set of 3 questions 
to a TA. Going back to my previous point, I have negative experience with this.
In my first oral homework, although I clearly said "(some operation) 
used by segment tree is associative because it just calculates the property 
of the combined interval, which is associative." The TA, holding a poker face 
the entire time, ask me why this 
operation is associative after I finished, and want me to talk about the 
proof again, even though this proof is already well known from a homework 
in a previous class. However, we are lucky enough that for some reason, 
Professor Danny Sleator will be responsible for the oral homework of my 
group. In a clear constrast with the TAs, he is a very chill and we have 
great interactions during the oral homework presentation.

Overall, I think I learned a lot from the 
content in this class, and I think this class for sure prepare one to dive 
deeper in algorithms after the basic algorithms in 15210. But anything else 
from teaching to logistics have ample room for improvements, to say the least.
Additionally, I must put a question mark on the TA hiring process 
of some of the classes I have taken in CMU. Let me en this post with a comment
in a public platform on midterm 1 posted by an anonymous person online who claims 
to be a TA of this class:

"451 students vs not being stupid, test was easy asl if u get less than 
85 drop the course its just an iqq diff atp - from a 451 TA." "The lion 
wonders how students made it this far without knowing binary search or basic 
hashing."
